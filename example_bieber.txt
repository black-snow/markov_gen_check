VERSE
You seem like the cross lights
Step to the wall
So tell me why am I in love with the thought of you, you, you
Could it be I don't want to knowâ€¦
Yeah I know it can't work
I was your boyfriend, I'd never leave you girl I see is you this Christmas
But love wins in the past behind
And I'ma be your silver
All I want for us

CHORUS
Only if you feel like I had the strength to take you ohh, where you wanna ride with me
You love me, you convinced me yeah
Oh how you do me like you do me
You seem like the sun rise

VERSE
What do you right now
Or we can make you feel the same
Love me, love me like a step child
If I was starstruck
It's you, it's you then holla!
This is how we do it to you
That's why you wanna ride with me
We just can't believe it
She was the last time

CHORUS
Only if you feel like I had the strength to take you ohh, where you wanna ride with me
You love me, you convinced me yeah
Oh how you do me like you do me
You seem like the sun rise
