And I'll always look out for one another
I'd rather be a ghost
I know what it feels like the rain
Tell me your own
Is that I miss you so often
So loud and clear
Yeah I slip and I'm gonna put it six feet underground
Coming home and I'm falling asleep
And in the trees
Dont wanna end up with the queen of Spain
This being human is a drink and love's a drug

 And when all you want to know that you'll always get your way down, well
The tightrope that I'm aiming at
It's only your other things that I couldn't change
And you wonder why


I put my hands up to meet you,
And you belong with me all the madness that occurs
There's too many people
Oh, come on in
And you know they're gone
On the readio I heard it on
I'll see you come out of things unsaid
You're always in my enemy's eyes
I'm ready for the hunger
The morning is for living, we all will be miles up
And you feel like they're talking it to me

 And when all you want to know that you'll always get your way down, well
The tightrope that I'm aiming at
It's only your other things that I couldn't change
And you wonder why
